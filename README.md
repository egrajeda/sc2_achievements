Starcraft II Achievements parser
================================

Download all the achievements of a SC2 player as JSON.

This library downloads all the achievements from a player's public profile,
extracts the relevant data and then convert it all to a JSON array, with the
most recent earned achievement first.

I'm planning to use this as a part of a bigger system, so that's why I haven't
built-in some sort of cache.

## INSTALLATION

Everything is nicely packed as a gem, so all you have to do is:

```
$ gem install sc2_achievements_parser
```

## USAGE

```
>> SC2AchievementsParser.get('/2693272/1/NakedSnake')
=> 
```
